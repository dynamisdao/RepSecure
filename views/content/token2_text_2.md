To insure 100 Rep send exactly 100 Rep to an address which holds at least 1 ETH + enough gas to process all transaction fees for executing the contract (1.2 ETH). From that address send 1 ETH to the contract along with the contract code which will initiate your policy. Once you are informed of the text ID (hash) of your transaction place your text ID (hash) in the form at the bottom. The price of Rep which is insured is determined by the time when the form (see section below) is submitted to the repsecure website.  The website uses an API price feed from coinmarketcap.com which records the price at the time of submission.  Do not remove your 100 Rep until after Dec. 15th or the contract will be void.

To insure larger amounts of Rep simply increase the premium paid by 1 Eth for every additional 100 Rep insured.
