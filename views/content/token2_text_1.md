If the current price of Rep is $6 you pay 1 ETH into a smart contract to secure that the future price of 100 Rep will be above $6 by Feb. 13th 2017.  The easiest way to specify a future date is to specify a block height.  The block height 3141592 will likely be mined on or prior to Feb. 13th 2017.  At this block height if the price of Rep is below the purchase price then the difference is paid out to policyholders.

**To protect the value of your 100 Rep, Rep-secure pays 200 Rep collateral into an ethereum smart contract.** So long as Reputation does not fall below a floor price of $2 then reputation token holders are fully protected against any losses due to a change in price.  If the price does fall below $2 then only a portion of people's losses would be mitigated.  This collateral protects policyholders in the following ways:

If the price of Rep at block 3141592 is above the current market price of $6 the collateral is returned to Rep-secure and the contract terminates.

If the price of Rep at block 3141592 is $5 which is $1 below the insured price of $6 then Rep-secure pays you 100 dollars in Ether and the collateral is returned to Rep-secure.  If Rep-secure fails to pay you the difference within the time allotted than the entire collateral would be forfeit to the insured party.

If the price of Rep at block 3141592 is $2 which is $4 below the insured price of $6 then the collateral would be forfeit to the insured party and the insured party would be able to sell their existing 100 Rep plus 200 Rep collateral for $2 to recover $600 the initial purchase price.

If the price of Rep at block 3141592 is $1.50 which is $4.50 below the insured price of $6 then the collateral would be forfeit to the insured party and the insured party would be able to sell their existing 100 Rep plus 200 Rep collateral for $1.50 to recover $450 or 75% of the initial purchase price.
