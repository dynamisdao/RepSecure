* A token can lose more than half of its value before an insured policyholder would be impacted by these losses.
* Allows people to make better informed decisions off of more information than merely the curators of the project being well known.

* Allows you to encourage friends and family to participate in new projects with minimal risk that they will lose their funds if a project fails to perform as expected.
* Anyone can use their assets to insure others.  How many insurers an asset has is a measure of peoples confidence in that asset.
* If many people are willing to use their assets to insure others it demonstrates that there are many long term investors who believe the coin has a future.
