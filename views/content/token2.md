### How it works

Insurance for standard contracts is purchased for units of 100 Rep (other sizes available below).  If the current price of Rep is $6 you pay 1 ETH into the contract to secure that the future price of 100 Rep will be above $6 at block 3141592 which would likely be mined on or prior to Feb. 13th. 2017 Rep secure pays 200 Rep collateral into the contract to secure a price above a floor of 2 dollars.

If the price of Rep at block 3141592 is above the current market price of $6 the collateral is returned to Rep secure and the contract terminates.

If the price of Rep at block 3141592 is $5 which is $1 below the current market price of $6 then Rep secure pays you 100 dollars in Ether and the collateral is returned to Rep secure.  If Rep secure fails to pay you the difference within the time allotted than the entire collateral would be forfeit to the insured party.

If the price of Rep at block 3141592 is $2 which is $4 below the current market price of $6 then the collateral would be forfeit to the insured party and the insured party would be able to sell their existing 100 Rep plus 200 Rep collateral for $2 to recover $600 the initial purchase price.

If the price of Rep at block 3141592 is $1.50 which is $4.50 below the current market price of $6 then the collateral would be forfeit to the insured party and the insured party would be able to sell their existing 100 Rep plus 200 Rep collateral for $1.50 to recover $450 or 75% of the initial purchase price.

Since reputation tokens serve as the collateral which secures the terms of the contract there is a floor price.  If the price of reputation falls below this floor then the contract only serves to mitigate a portion of the losses incurred.
