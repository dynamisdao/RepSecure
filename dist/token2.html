<p><strong>REP Secure</strong> is a multi-signature financial contract that allows you to secure the current market price of your reputation tokens at a future date.  It uses reputation tokens as collateral to enforce the difference between the current price of REP and the future price within a certain window.</p><br><!-- Controls--><div class="panel-heading row"><div class="col-md-9"><p>Current ETH price: </p></div><div class="col-md-3"><p class="strong"><strong id="eth-price">$</strong></p></div><div class="col-md-9"><p>Current Rep price: </p></div><div class="col-md-3"><p class="strong"><strong id="price">$</strong></p></div></div><div class="panel-control row"><div class="col-md-9"><p>Ammount of Rep you want to insure: </p></div><div class="col-md-3"><div class="right-width"><select id="amount" class="form-control"><option value="0">100 Rep</option><option value="1">500 Rep</option><option value="2">1000 Rep</option></select></div></div><div class="col-md-9"><p>Price of Rep on Feb 13th, 2017: </p></div><div class="col-md-3"><div class="right-width"><input type="text" value="" disabled id="future-price-edit" class="form-control"></div></div><div class="col-md-12"> <p><input type="range" min="2" step="0.25" id="future-price"></p></div><div class="col-md-9"><p>Cost of purchasing insurance:</p></div><div class="col-md-3"><div class="right-width"><input type="text" value="$xxx" disabled id="cost" class="form-control"></div></div><div class="col-md-9"><p>Potential losses if you don’t purchase a policy: </p></div><div class="col-md-3"><div class="right-width"><input type="text" disabled id="losses" class="form-control"></div></div><div class="col-md-9"><p>Potential savings if you do purchase a policy:</p></div><div class="col-md-3"><div class="right-width"><input type="text" disabled id="savings" class="form-control"></div></div></div><!-- Main:--><h3>How it works</h3>

<p>Insurance for standard contracts is purchased for units of 100 Rep (other sizes available below).  If the current price of Rep is $6 you pay 1 ETH into the contract to secure that the future price of 100 Rep will be above $6 at block 3141592 which would likely be mined on or prior to Feb. 13th. 2017 Rep secure pays 200 Rep collateral into the contract to secure a price above a floor of 2 dollars.</p>

<p>If the price of Rep at block 3141592 is above the current market price of $6 the collateral is returned to Rep secure and the contract terminates.</p>

<p>If the price of Rep at block 3141592 is $5 which is $1 below the current market price of $6 then Rep secure pays you 100 dollars in Ether and the collateral is returned to Rep secure.  If Rep secure fails to pay you the difference within the time allotted than the entire collateral would be forfeit to the insured party.</p>

<p>If the price of Rep at block 3141592 is $2 which is $4 below the current market price of $6 then the collateral would be forfeit to the insured party and the insured party would be able to sell their existing 100 Rep plus 200 Rep collateral for $2 to recover $600 the initial purchase price.</p>

<p>If the price of Rep at block 3141592 is $1.50 which is $4.50 below the current market price of $6 then the collateral would be forfeit to the insured party and the insured party would be able to sell their existing 100 Rep plus 200 Rep collateral for $1.50 to recover $450 or 75% of the initial purchase price.</p>

<p>Since reputation tokens serve as the collateral which secures the terms of the contract there is a floor price.  If the price of reputation falls below this floor then the contract only serves to mitigate a portion of the losses incurred.</p><!-- Instructions:--><p id="std-contract"><strong>Standard contracts </strong>units of exactly 100 Rep.

<p>Standard Contracts with a floor of $2 can be purchased for 1 ETH
     Deposits an escrow of (Current Rep Price * 50 * 1) – 100 REP</p>

<p>Fiat Contracts with a floor of $2 can be purchased for 5 ETH
     Deposits an escrow of (Current Rep Price * 50 * 5) – 500 REP</p>

<p>Grand Contracts with a floor of $2 can be purchased for 10 ETH
     Deposits an escrow of (Current Rep Price * 50 * 10) – 1000 REP</p>

<h3>Terms and Conditions</h3>

<p>The terms of the contract are enforced using an Ethereum multsig which directs the entire Rep escrow to either the insured party or back to <strong>Rep Secure</strong> at a future date after block 3141592. A weighted weekly average for the last 7 days prior to block 3141592 is used to determine the price. Once the price is determined if the future price is below the insured price then <strong>Rep Secure</strong> will pay to make up the difference in Ether in order to redeem the Rep used as collateral. If <strong>Rep Secure</strong> fails to pay the difference within 120 days then the collateral is paid in full to the insured party.  If the price is below the 2 dollar floor at block 3141592 then the collateral is released to the insured party.</p>

<p>No price above 9 dollars will be secured with this contract.  If the current market price is above 9 dollars and a policy is purchased then a deposit which insures a maximum price of 9 dollars will be calculated.</p>

<p>Policyholders assume all risks associated with the transmit of Ethers to the policy made incorrectly.  No policies will be issued after Dec. 15th 2016.  Moving any portion of the Rep insured prior to that date to another address will void the contract.</p>

<p>A maximum of 30,000 Rep can be insured by this contract.  After this maximum is reached no further Rep will be insured.</p>
